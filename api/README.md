Fresh Laravel API scaffold with Breeze? It’s lean and API-first: all routes live in api.php, controllers are minimal (auth handled via RegisteredUserController and AuthenticatedSessionController), and models like User come with Sanctum for token auth. Migrations are ready (users, personal_access_tokens), middleware is set for stateless API calls, and JSON responses are default. Perfect for adding resources, policies, and versioned endpoints without touching frontend logic—fully extendable and production-ready.Fresh Laravel API scaffold with Breeze?
