## Testing Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd /workspace/api
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd /workspace
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Accounts
The system includes pre-seeded test accounts:

**Super Admin:**
- Email: edmond@system.com
- Password: admin123

**School Admin (Kampala Primary):**
- Email: sarah@kampala.primary.ug
- Password: password123

**Teacher:**
- Email: mary@kampala.primary.ug
- Password: teacher123

**Student:**
- Email: john@kampala.primary.ug
- Password: student123
